        <p><h2>History of Chelsea Football Club</h2>
            Chelsea FC, founded in 1905, is based in Fulham, London. The club was established at Stamford Bridge, a ground originally intended for athletics but transformed into a football stadium. <br>
            Chelsea quickly joined the Football League and gained a reputation for their large crowds and big-name signings, though early success was limited.<br>
            
            Chelsea won their first major trophy, the League Championship, in 1955. However, consistent success eluded the club until the 1990s, when new ownership and investments revitalized the team.<br>
             Roman Abramovich's takeover in 2003 marked a turning point, enabling Chelsea to become one of England’s most successful clubs.<br><br>
